His front door was unlocked, and after searching every room upstairs with no sign of him, I noticed the basement door slightly ajar. I crept down the creaky steps, the dim light from a small lamp casting long shadows across the cluttered space. Behind a stack of boxes, Max crouched with a mischievous grin on his face. “You found me,” he chuckled. “Took you long enough.” I rolled my eyes, half-laughing, already planning my revenge for the next round of hide-and-seek.")
